    "Under the null hypothesis of equal variances, the F-statistic follows an F-distribution with (n1 - 1) and (n2 - 1) degrees of freedom. We can use a statistical software or a table of F-distribution to find the critical value of F for a 1% significance level with (n1 - 1) and (n2 - 1) degrees of freedom.\n",

    "F = s1^2 / s2^2 = 22.50 / 8.67 = 2.59\n",

    "Since the calculated F-statistic (2.59) is less than the critical value of F (7.708), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest that the variances of the test scores of the two groups of students are significantly different at the 1% significance level."
