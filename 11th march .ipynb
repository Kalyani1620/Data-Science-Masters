    "To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the weight loss drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level using a t-test, we can follow these steps:\n",

    "Step 1: State the hypotheses\n",
    "The null hypothesis (H0): The weight loss drug is not significantly effective; the true population mean weight loss is equal to or less than 0.\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis (H1): The weight loss drug is significantly effective; the true population mean weight loss is greater than 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "Step 3: Calculate the test statistic\n",
    "For this hypothesis test, we will use a t-test because we are dealing with a sample of 50 participants and the population standard deviation is not known. We will calculate the t-test statistic using the formula:\n",

    "At a 95% confidence level, the critical value for a one-tailed test (since the alternative hypothesis is one-sided) with a sample size of 50 is approximately 1.676, using a t-distribution table or a statistical calculator. Alternatively, we can find the p-value associated with the calculated test statistic using a t-distribution table or a statistical calculator.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, the calculated test statistic (t-value) of 16.997 is much greater than the critical value of 1.676, and the p-value associated with the calculated test statistic is extremely small (much less than 0.05). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the weight loss drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level."
