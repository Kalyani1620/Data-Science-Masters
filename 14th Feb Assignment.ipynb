In other applications, performance can be unaffected or even degraded by using multithreading and multicontexting together. How performance is affected depends on your application.\n",
    "* Simplified coding of remote procedure calls and conversations\n",
    "In some applications it is easier to code different remote procedure calls and conversations in separate threads than to manage them from the same thread.\n",
    "* Simultaneous access to multiple applications\n",
    "Your BEA Tuxedo clients can be connected to more than one application at a time.\n",
    "* Reduced number of required servers\n",
    "Because one server can dispatch multiple service threads, the number of servers to start for your application is reduced. This capability for multiple dispatched threads is especially useful for conversational servers, which otherwise must be dedicated to one client for the entire duration of a conversation.\n",

    "It is much harder to replicate an error in a multithreaded or multicontexted application than it is to do so in a single-threaded, single-contexted application. As a result, it is more difficult, in the former case, to identify and verify root causes when errors occur.\n",
    "* Difficulty of managing concurrency\n",

    "The task of managing concurrency among threads is difficult and has the potential to introduce new problems into an application.\n",
    "* Difficulty of testing\n",
