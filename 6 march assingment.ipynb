If income is measured as a nominal variable (e.g., low, middle, high), using a t-test to compare the means of the two groups would be inappropriate because the variable is not continuous and has no numerical value. In this case, a more appropriate statistical test would be a chi-square test to determine if there is a significant difference in the distribution of income levels between the two groups.\n",
