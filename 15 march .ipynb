    "The training set is the portion of the dataset used to train or fit the machine learning model. It contains labeled data with input features and their corresponding target labels. During the training phase, the model learns patterns and relationships in the training data to make accurate predictions or classifications.

The test set is used to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data and to estimate its performance on real-world examples. Evaluating the model on a test set provides an unbiased measure of its performance and helps identify potential issues like overfitting (when the model memorizes the training data without generalizing well).\n",

The validation set allows assessing the model's performance on data that it hasn't seen during training and helps in choosing the best model architecture, optimizing hyperparameters, or making decisions regarding the model's configuration.

    "1. Performance Evaluation: The test set provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on new, unseen data, allowing for an objective assessment of its effectiveness. It helps measure how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generalization Assessment: The test set helps identify whether the model has overfit or underfit the training data. If the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the test set, it indicates overfitting. This insight helps in adjusting the model's complexity or regularization techniques to improve generalization.\n",
