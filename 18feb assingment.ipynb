    "**SOAP**:-\n",
    "* SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is an XML-based protocol for accessing web services over HTTP. It is developed as an intermediate language so that applications built in various programming languages can communicate with each other effectively. Web services use SOAP for exchange of XML data between applications. SOAP supports both stateful and stateless operations. Stateful means that the server keeps the information that it receives from the client across multiple requests. These requests are chained together so that the server is aware about the previous requests. Examples are bank transactions, flight bookings, etc. Stateless messaging has enough information about the state of the client so that the server does not have to bother.\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST**:-\n",
    "* REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural approach for communication purposes often used in various web services development. It is a stateless client-server model. Web services that are defined on the concept of REST are RESTful web services. When a client makes a request via RESTful API, it transfers the representation of the state of the resources to the server. This information can be transferred in various formats via HTTP like, JSON, HTML, XLT, and Plain Text, but JSON is the most common language used due to its easy readability by machines and humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shortcomings of SOAP**:-\n",
    "\n",
    "As SOAP can only transfer messages as XML files, your SOAP API will be less performant, as XML is a verbose format compared to JSON. API calls made to your server will need more bandwidth and it will take more time to process the request and transfer the response back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SOAP, the client-server communication depends on WSDL (Web Service Description Language) contracts, which implies tight coupling. Therefore, it’s not recommended for loosely coupled applications as you can’t opt out of using a contract between the client and the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP also has a higher learning curve, is harder to code, and can’t be tested in the web browser (as opposed to REST). With SOAP, you need to generate contracts in WSDL, create client stubs, follow strict specifications, and more. This also means that as a programmer, you’ll also have less freedom of choice."
